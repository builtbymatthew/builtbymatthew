## Hi there 👋

My name is Matthew Pearson, and I’m an Electronics and Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in embedded systems, hardware-software integration, and building practical tech solutions.

  - [Product Website](https://elexprep.wixsite.com/laplogic)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift for iOS development, exploring advanced C programming for embedded applications, and experimenting with other languages like Python.
