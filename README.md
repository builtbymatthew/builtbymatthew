## Hi there 👋

My name is Matthew Pearson, and I am a Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in embedded systems, hardware-software integration, and building practical tech solutions.

- 🛠️ I’m currently developing an iOS application that enhances a wireless automotive telemetry system already in use. 
  - [Product Website](https://elexprep.wixsite.com/laplogic)
- 🧠 I’m currently learning Swift for iOS development, exploring advanced C programming for embedded applications, and experimenting with other languages like Python.  
- 👨‍💻 I'm passionate about all things software—always eager to learn, tinker, and build across different platforms.
